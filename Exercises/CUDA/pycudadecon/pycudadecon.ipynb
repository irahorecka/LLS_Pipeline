    "This package provides a python wrapper and convenience functions for cudaDeconv, which is a CUDA/C++ implementation of an accelerated Richardson Lucy Deconvolution algorithm1, suitable for general applications, but designed particularly for stage-scanning light sheet applications such as Lattice Light Sheet. cudaDeconv was originally written by Lin Shao and modified by Dan Milkie, at Janelia Research campus. This package makes use of a cross-platform shared library interface that I wrote for cudaDecon while developing LLSpy (a Lattice light-sheet post-processing utility), that adds a couple additional kernels for affine transformations and camera corrections. The code here is mostly extracted from that package and cleaned up to allow it to be used independently of LLSpy."
