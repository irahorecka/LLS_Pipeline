HOW TO INSTALL CUDA TOOLKIT (v10.1 (required for cupy) or 10.2) AND USE CUDA FOR PYTHON APPLICATIONS (for Windows)
https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html

check that you have CUDA-capable GPU
	Viz2 UCB ABC -- NVIDIA Quadro GV100
download appropriate CUDA Toolkit for your OS (Windows 10)
	follow prompt - choose Express download
try sample code provided by NVIDIA
	if build fails, look at error message:
		e.g. Windows SDK registry variable not found
		in this case, you must install SDK via the VSCode program on your computer (look @ kalmiya's response)
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22188919/windows-sdk-registry-variable-not-found
	it should work after this. test sample code and look @ GPU usage on task manager to verify
		in case you receive an empty directory error, look into this... (access sample folder properties via VSCode)
		https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1042441/cuda-setup-and-installation/the-cuda-toolkit-v10-0-directory-does-not-exist-/
		use this path in the CUDA Toolkit Custom Dir: C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v10.2
	NOTE: THE ABOVE EXAMPLE FAILED FOR CUDA TOOLKIT V10.2
	      UNINSTALL V10.2 AND INSTALL 10.1

Supposedly you can conda install the CUDA toolkit, though I have not tried.
	$ conda install cudatoolkit=10.1
