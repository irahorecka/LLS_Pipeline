HOW TO INSTALL CUDA TOOLKIT (v10.1 (required for cupy) or 10.2) AND USE CUDA FOR PYTHON APPLICATIONS (for Windows)
https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html

check that you have CUDA-capable GPU
	Viz2 UCB ABC -- NVIDIA Quadro GV100
download appropriate CUDA Toolkit for your OS (Windows 10)
	follow prompt - choose Express download
try sample code provided by NVIDIA
	if build fails, look at error message:
		e.g. Windows SDK registry variable not found
		in this case, you must install SDK via the VSCode program on your computer (look @ kalmiya's response)
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22188919/windows-sdk-registry-variable-not-found
	it should work after this. test sample code and look @ GPU usage on task manager to verify
		in case you receive an empty directory error, look into this... (access sample folder properties via VSCode)
		https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1042441/cuda-setup-and-installation/the-cuda-toolkit-v10-0-directory-does-not-exist-/
		use this path in the CUDA Toolkit Custom Dir: C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v10.2
	NOTE: THE ABOVE EXAMPLE FAILED FOR CUDA TOOLKIT V10.2
	      UNINSTALL V10.2 AND INSTALL 10.1
	
WORKING WITH CUPY WITH CUDA TOOLKIT V10.1
	Install appropriate CUDA Toolkit V10.1
	Restart computer
	Open command prompt (Windows 10) and if you are working with a virtualenv + anaconda virtualenv:
		$ workon venv_py
		$ set path=""
		$ call path venv_anaconda3
	$ pip install cupy
		if you get: error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.1 is required. Get it with "Build Tools for Visual Studio": https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
		visit this link and download cpp build tools: https://www.scivision.co/python-windows-visual-c-14-required/
			FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY...
	if you are STILL receiving cpp 14.1 error, try this instead
	$ pip install cupy-cuda101 (if you have CUDA toolkit 10.1)
		this should work
	Open python repl and type:
		>>>import cupy
	this should work!
