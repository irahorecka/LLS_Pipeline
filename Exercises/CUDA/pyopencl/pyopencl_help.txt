PyOpenCL gives you easy, Pythonic access to the OpenCL parallel computation API.

What is OpenCL
	OpenCL™ (Open Computing Language) is the open, royalty-free standard for cross-platform, parallel programming of 
	diverse processors found in personal computers, servers, mobile devices and embedded platforms. OpenCL greatly improves
	the speed and responsiveness of a wide spectrum of applications in numerous market categories including gaming and 
	entertainment titles, scientific and medical software, professional creative tools, vision processing, and neural
	network training and inferencing.


INSTALLING PYOPENCL ON WINDOWS 10 (2020-02-05)
pyopencl [CRITICAL LIB]
		- Make sure pybind11, mako are installed (use pip)
		- For Windows 10, import from wheel, make sure to choose the right Python version.
		- Check bit no. for Windows 10 via a python repl like this:
		>>> import platform
		>>> platform.architecture()
		('64bit', 'WindowsPE')
		- Go to https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyopencl to download the appropriate wheel
		- For Viz2, we are running python 3.7.6, with a 64bit OS, therefore we would download:
		pyopencl-2019.1.2+cl21-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl
			notice the cp37, this corresponds to Cpython 3.7
		- Then, pip install directly from the downloaded wheel like this:
		$ pip install "C:\Users\Viz2\Downloads\pyopencl-2019.1.2+cl21-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl"

		- Test for successful installation:
		>>> import pyopencl
		- Unfortunately, I receive this for the time being:
		ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified procedure could not be found.

		- You can also try conda install -c conda-forge pyopencl
			still ImportError
		- for AMP APP SDK 3.0 setup help
		- file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/AMD%20APP%20SDK/3.0/docs/AMD_APP_SDK_GettingStartedGuide.pdf
			can build sample applications for OpenCL, but no luck in pyopencl import.

		UPDATE:
		- no luck troubleshooting ImportError. Followed wiki to no avail (below):
