WORKING WITH NUMBA
	"Numba is an open source, NumPy-aware optimizing compiler for Python sponsored by Anaconda, Inc. 
	It uses the LLVM compiler project to generate machine code from Python syntax."
	Numba is already preinstalled in the Anaconda environment (to the best of my knowledge)
	You can always install Numba like so:
	$ pip install numba
