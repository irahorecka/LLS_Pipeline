NAPARI MOVIE
https://github.com/guiwitz/naparimovie

Napari movie (naparimovie) provides the possibility of creating movies (mp4 or gif) from the napari GUI visualization.
Currently, once you are satisfied with editing your image on napari GUI, you will go to the first frame (ndisplay=3)
and click 'F'. Then, you will mouse to the last frame in the napari GUI and again click 'F'. DO NOT click 'F' more than
twice (one in the beginning, one in the end), or an exception will be thrown.
Then, you will call a function (movie.make_gif('example.gif')) from the the Movie instansiation to make your movie.

Overall, this is a very useful library in saving napari image files.

Hack ideas for naparimovie to be implemented with
 the LLS_Pipeline:
- Remove key bindings ('F', etc.)
- Allow easy text input or JSON input for image manipulation
- Allow dask.distributed or multiprocessing of images to movie if possible
- Create an easier method to generating gifs movies via napari (long shot).
