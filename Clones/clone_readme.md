## README for Clones directory (LLS_Pipeline/Clones)

### Purpose
The purpose of this folder is to allow contributions and manipulations of github repositories.<br>

Viz2 at ABC (UC Berkeley) has a git terminal. Please use this terminal if you make any changes to any of these repositories and would like to push or merge your commits to the native repository.<br>

1) ```napari```
    - ```napari``` is an image manipulation python library that leverages PyQT5 for a GUI interface, allowing its users to adjust and manipulate images (2D, 3D, and 4D).
2) ```naparimovie```
    - ```naparimovie``` is a wrapper for napari that allows the user to make a movie of any timelapse movies made via napari (e.g. a 4D image). You can create a movie or gif of your animation otherwise impossible using napari alone.

### Nice to haves
A nice to have feature is to join napari and naparimovie into one. It would be ideal to have the naparimovie feature directly shipped with the napari library, allowing users to easily make movies from their images.
